Wordpress Theme "Secluded" version 0.1

Thanks for choosing to use the Secluded theme with WordPress.

Theme Settings:

The theme is fairly straight forward and easy to setup. It has two sidebar widget
areas, by default the primary is loaded with the search form, archives, and the 
meta links.
You can also choose to use the menu, by default it will be empty but if you 
navigate to the menu setup page you will be able to define and setup a menu 
with the links you want.
The only other currently available option is the background, you can change the 
color to something that suits you or you can choose to make it an image.
